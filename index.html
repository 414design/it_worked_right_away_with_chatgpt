            <p>
                Why do we so often choose the easy way? “It worked right away
                with ChatGPT” is a design toolkit and experiment that uses AI
                and vibe coding to expand creative possibilities—without any
                proprietary, closed models. Developed by students at Darmstadt
                University of Applied Sciences, it proves that open language
                models can empower designers and enable novel approaches. A call
                to use AI not just for convenience, but consciously.
