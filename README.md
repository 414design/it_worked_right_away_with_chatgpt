## About

This project is a collection of experimental design tools created by students at **Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences**. It demonstrates how open language models can empower designers and enable novel, conscious approaches to creativity—not just for convenience, but for exploration and innovation.

Each tool is built using open-source AI models and web technologies, proving that powerful, creative tools can be developed without relying on closed systems.

## Features

- **13 unique design tools**: From typography editors to color playgrounds, animation tools, and more.
- **Open-source AI**: Built with models like Qwen, DeepSeek, Kimi, and others.
- **Interactive and playful**: Drag, click, and explore each tool in a dynamic, card-based interface.
- **No proprietary models**: All tools are created using open frameworks and assistive AI.
